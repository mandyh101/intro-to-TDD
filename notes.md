## NOTES


# Error types
Errors give you clues! 

-  reference error is when the test has nothing (no code) to reference

- an assertion error is when something isn't defined e.g when a variable isn't defined or a function isnt returning anything
  - Remember, functions that donâ€™t explicitly return something will implicitly return undefined.
